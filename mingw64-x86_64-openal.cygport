DESCRIPTION="OpenAL Soft is an LGPL-licensed, cross-platform, software

playing audio in a virtual 3D environment. Distance attenuation, doppler shift,
and directional sound emitters are among the features handled by the API. More
advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion, and environmental
reverb, are available through the EFX extension. It also facilitates streaming
